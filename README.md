DiscFinder

A web application that connects disc golf disc finders and owners.

Idea: Often, lost discs don’t make it back to their owners. There is a Facebook group where finders and losers post information about found or lost discs. However, since there can be a long time gap between losing and finding, these posts disappear from Facebook fairly quickly. Additionally, for example, a large number of discs found in water bodies are usually posted in a single long post or photo on Facebook, making it difficult to identify the owners.

How the Application Works:

Users need to register. A user can enter a lost or found disc and describe various properties of the disc:

Location of loss/finding (on a map, or with disc golf course and basket precision)

Date and time of loss/finding

Manufacturer

Name/label

Plastic type

Color

Name/number on the back of the disc

Estimated condition of the disc

The application compares lost and found discs and matches possible overlaps. Users can contact each other, and if both confirm that it is the correct disc or owner, they can arrange further details, and the disc is removed from both databases.
